# bash-tryouts
Learning bash as a pre-alpha quality hobby

Results oriented mindset. Tooling and skills just help for delivery of results.

Some tooling and scripting tricks someone might find a bit awkward for
the typical bash scripting standards:

- rg (ripgrep) - I feel it like a better (a tad faster) rusty grep.
- zsh - a shell which I find splendid, it's location is /usr/bin/zsh
- printf instead of echo for a change. \n :)
- busybox shuf - a nice shuffling utility but its busybox variant
- play from the sox package
- wget as a curl alternative
- adb - the Android Debug Bridge as the normies know it.
- for evaluation [[  ]] instead of [  ]
- for substitution use $() instead of backticking ``
- restic - backups done not left but righty-ish
- msmtp - at least a maintained utility for emailing
- hg - mercurial versioning
- ipset - nice utility for you know... better iptables management
