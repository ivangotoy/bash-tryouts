If you happen to have dnscrypt proxy 2 running - that's great.

If you don't have it you can learn how to obtain it from here:

Encrypting your dns activity on a single device or your router taking care of LAN is one thing

but using dnscrypt 2 as ad blocker is so much more fun. Here how to do it:

- in dnscrypt-proxy.toml make sure you configure:


[blocked_names]

  ## Path to the file of blocking rules (absolute, or relative to the same directory as the config file)

blocked_names_file = 'blocked-names.txt'

- in system crontab add a similar entry to the one below.

@daily curl -s https://dblw.oisd.nl/ -o /etc/dnscrypt-proxy2/blocked-names.txt && sync && sleep 5 && /etc/init.d/dnscrypt-proxy restart


N.B. Make sure /etc/dnscrypt-proxy2/blocked-names.txt in cron is adjusted to the correct location on your system.

That's all folks :)
